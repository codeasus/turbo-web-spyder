# TurboSpyder

  TurboSpyder is a side project that has been developed to collect enough data from the website [Turbo.az](https://turbo.az/) in order to boost one of our machine learning projects. As the website does not provide any kind of API for educational/"scientific" purposes, we had to it the "hard" way.


### Features!

  - Obviously, collect all the cars available in the webiste using brute-force methods.
  - Default multi-tread options are availablse however for a better/desired performace/result code modification is requried.
  - The code is not a MESS!
